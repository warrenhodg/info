Create your own code signing cert:
In Keychain Access, Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Create a certificate. This launches the Certificate Assistant:
Name: Enter some arbitrary string here that you can remember. Avoid spaces otherwise you'll need to escape the cert's name when using codesign from the command line.
Identity type: Self Signed Root
Certificate Type: Code Signing
Check the box "Let me override defaults", this is quite important
Serial number: 1 (OK as long as the cert name/serial no. combination is unique)
Validity Period: 3650 (gives you 10 years)
Email, Name, etc. fill out as you wish.
Key pair info: set to RSA, 2048 bits. Does not really matter IMHO.
From "Key usage extension" up to "Subject Alternate Name Extension": accept the defaults.
Location: login keychain.
Once it is created, set to "Always trust" in the Login keychain: right-click on the certificate, choose "Get Info", and in the "Trust" section, set "When using this certificate" to "Always trust".
Re-signing an app: codesign -f --deep -s <certname> /path/to/app
Verify that it worked: codesign -dvvvv /path/to/app
