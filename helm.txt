Tricks:
To force a pod restart, even though only the contents of a config change, use annotation on the pod (not the deployment).
This effectively changes the definition of the pod, causing a restart.

spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        checksum/init-config: {{ include (print $.Template.BasePath "/<filename of definition>) . | sha256sum }}

This will render the specified helm file, hash it, and store it in the annotation
