loki query language:
  description:
    broken down into two parts:
      - a label matcher, which matches labels like prometheus does
      - a filter expression for the rest of the line. Operators:
        - "|= contains string"
        - "!= does not contain string"
        - "|~ matches regex"
        - "!~ does not match regex"
    examples:
      - '{app="frontend"} |= "level=debug" |= "path=/api/v1/query"'
      - '{app="frontend"} |~ "5\d{2}"'
    supports range vectors:
      examples:
        - 'rate({cluster="us-central1"} |= "error: .*" [5m])'
    supports vector aggregations:
      examples:
        - 'sum by(job, instance) (rate({cluster="us-central1"} |= "error" [5m]))'
